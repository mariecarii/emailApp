## Project Description
This project's goal was to create an application that helps companies generate emails for their employees. It takes in the user's first name, last name, and department. It returns a random password. It also allows you to change the password and define an alternate email.

## Languages 
Java 

## How to Run 
Open in your IDE. Create a new object and insert the first and last name.

## How to Use 
This would be used by companies needing to generate company emails and passwords for their new hires.

## Future Plans 
I would like to develope this into a larger scale project. This means something that looks more like a website (isn't being run in the terminal). It would generate the email, send the information to the employee, and keep a confidental copy. 
There is a lot of room to get creative with the project! I've just laid out the ground work.
